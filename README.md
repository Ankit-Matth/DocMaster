## 🚩 Problem Statement

### 🔹 Problem 1
Most existing PDF editors are not user-friendly. Features like adding text, annotations, images, signatures, rubber stamps, or drawing on PDFs are either missing or complex to use. This leads to a frustrating and inefficient user experience.

### 🔹 Problem 2
Users often need to juggle multiple tools just to perform basic tasks. For example:
> To convert all pages of a PDF to PNG using tools like iLovePDF, users must convert PDF to JPG, download a ZIP, extract it, then individually convert each JPG to PNG — an unnecessarily complex and time-consuming process.
